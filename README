The main program will call a test harness for the string table ADT. The test harness will work as
follows : after filtering the input through the C preprocessor, read a line using fgets(3), and tokenize
it using strtok_r(3), with the string "\ \t\n", i.e., spaces, tabls, and newline characters, and insert it
into the string table. After that, the main program will call the string table ADT opration to dump
the string table into its trace file. See the example in the subdirectory cppstrtok for an illustration of
how to call the C preprocessor. Your program will not read the raw file, only the output of cpp.
Do not confuse the program cpp, which is the C preprocessor with the suffix .cpp, commonly used to
indicate a C++ program, compiled via the g++ compiler.
The purpose of the string table is to keep tracks of strings in a unique manner. For example, if the
string "abc" is entered multiple times, it appears only once in the table. This means that instead of
using strcmp(3) to determine if two entries in the hash table are the same, one can simply compare
the pointers.
